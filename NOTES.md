## Future Improvements

### OSM Data Quality

**Filtering improvements:**
- Exclude `highway=service` with `access=private` (driveways)
- Exclude waterways incorrectly tagged as roads
- Exclude unnamed roads under certain length
- Validate against water bodies (segments shouldn't be in lakes/rivers)
- Check segment density to detect missing or excessive data

**Alternative data sources:**
- Vermont state GIS road centerlines (more accurate than OSM)
- New Hampshire DOT road data
- Generate segments from actual GPS tracks (reverse-engineer network from real usage)
- Hybrid approach: OSM base + GPS refinement + state data validation

**Automated validation:**
- Check segment density (segments per kmÂ²)
- Verify major roads are present
- Compare total road length to expected value
- Flag suspicious features automatically

### System Reliability

**Signal loss handling:**
- What happens when tracker enters dead zone?
- Queue points locally on device
- Process when signal returns
- Detect and handle gaps in GPS data

**Server monitoring:**
- Monitoring dashboard for system health
- Alerts when things break (email, SMS, Slack)
- Automatic restart for crashed services
- Failover strategy for critical components

**Backup & recovery:**
- Automated daily database backups
- Tested recovery procedures
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Backup retention policy

**Scaling preparation:**
- Currently handles 1 town with 1 vehicle
- Need to support 50+ towns with multiple vehicles each
- Performance testing under load
- Query optimization as data grows
- Consider database partitioning strategies

## Business & Market Notes

### Design Philosophy

**Build before selling:**
- Polished, reliable product before approaching customers
- This is B2G (business-to-government) - reputation matters
- Bad first impression with one town can poison the well with neighbors
- Small market, long sales cycles, word-of-mouth is critical

**Solo operation requirements:**
- System must "just works" without constant intervention
- Can't provide 24/7 support during active snowstorms while also selling and developing
- Operational simplicity is worth upfront complexity
- Automate everything possible

### Market Characteristics

**Target customers:**
- Municipal governments (B2G)
- Small number of potential customers in region
- Risk-averse buyers (public sector)
- Long sales cycles (budget cycles, committee approvals)
- High value per customer (ongoing annual licensing)

**Competition:**
- Larger fleet management systems (expensive, complex)
- Generic GPS tracking (lacks domain-specific features)
- No direct competitors focused on resident transparency

**Value proposition:**
- Reduce calls to town office during storms
- Transparency for residents ("when was my street plowed?")
- Coverage metrics for municipalities
- Historical reporting for budget justification
- Relatively affordable vs enterprise solutions

### Timeline & Milestones

**Winter 2025-26 season:**
- Sales should begin summer/fall 2025
- Need working demo before approaching towns
- Towns budget for winter in summer/fall
- Installation needed before first snowfall

**Pre-launch checklist:**
1. 99%+ uptime demonstrated
2. Clean UI suitable for embedding on town websites
3. Core value delivered (residents can see plow status)
4. Real-time demo with actual GPS data
5. Can handle 10 towns simultaneously
6. Basic admin panel for municipalities

- Historical playback (replay past storms)
- Export reports for town meetings
- Multi-user access with role-based permissions

**Coverage analytics:**
- % of road network serviced in last X hours
- Average time between service for each street
- Frequency of service per segment
- Identify underserved areas
- Compare performance across storms
- Generate reports for public meetings

### Resident Features

**Text alert system:**
- Resident signup: phone number + address
- SMS notification when street is plowed
- Geofencing logic to detect vehicle in area
- Rate limiting (avoid spam from multiple passes)
- Opt-in/opt-out management
- Integration with Twilio or similar
- Cost model: municipality pays vs resident pays

**Enhanced map features:**
- Mobile app vs responsive web (decision needed)
- Save favorite locations
- Notifications for specific streets
- Share links to specific locations
- Compare current storm to previous storms
- Time-lapse visualization of coverage

### Super-Admin Features

**Onboarding system:**

**Pricing considerations:**
- Per-municipality annual licensing
- Tiered based on municipality size (population? road miles?)
- One-time setup fee vs ongoing subscription
- Cost of GPS hardware (rent vs buy)
- SMS notification costs (pass-through to municipality or resident?)

## Architecture Decisions Log

### Why Segment Model?

**Decision:** Use discrete 50m road segments instead of displaying raw polylines to residents

**Reasoning:**
- Clean visualization (no overlapping polylines)
- Easy coverage metrics ("83% of roads serviced")
- Fixed dataset size (performance scales well)
- Operational simplicity (fewer edge cases)
- Better product-market fit for B2G customers

**Trade-off:** More complex database schema upfront

**Mitigation:** AI-assisted development makes database iteration practical

### Why Keep Polylines?

**Decision:** Store polylines even though segments are displayed

**Reasoning:**
- Polylines are authoritative source (actual GPS-derived paths)
- Needed for admin/debug (historical replay)
- Needed for advanced analytics (how did vehicle actually drive?)
- Segments are just visualization layer

**Hybrid architecture:** Best of both worlds

### Why 50m Segments?

**Decision:** Segment roads into 50m chunks (not 25m or 100m)

**Reasoning:**
- Granular enough for meaningful tracking
- Not so small that database explodes
- Typical plow speed: crossing segment in 3-6 seconds
- GPS reports every 30s: multiple reports per segment

**Trade-off:** Could adjust if needed per municipality

## Conversation History & Context

### Key Design Discussions

**Deduplication complexity:**
- Discussed problem: single polyline overlap vs cumulative overlap
- Considered ST_Difference approach (trim overlapping segments)
- Concluded: segment model solves this more elegantly

**Performance insights:**
- Segment model drastically more efficient than polyline accumulation
- 1,000 segments per town vs 9,000+ polylines from few drives
- Fixed dataset size means predictable scaling
- Mobile devices benefit from simple, cacheable data

**Operational simplicity:**
- Complexity front-loaded in setup phase (OSM import)
- Runtime is trivial (just timestamp updates)
- Critical for solo operation during storms
- Can't afford complex failures during peak usage

**Product-market fit:**
- Municipalities care about "which streets serviced" not "exact vehicle path"
- Coverage statistics sell better than pretty maps
- Segment model delivers both: clean map + metrics

### Implementation Journey

**Pomfret boundary fix:**
- Initial OSM import created invalid tiny boundary (0.57 kmÂ² vs 102.45 kmÂ²)
- Multi-way relations weren't properly assembled
- Created fix-pomfret-osm.js to connect ways correctly
- Learned lesson: always validate boundary before segment import

**Segment activation:**
- Initially thought would need custom code
- Discovered workers already implemented activation logic
- Just worked once segments were imported correctly
- 4,105 activations after first day confirmed success

**Frontend display:**
- Segments already rendering on map (green/red/yellow)
- Color gradient based on recency working well
- Both segments AND polylines showing (will deprecate polylines later)
- Performance good even with full week of data
